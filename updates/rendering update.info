This is an complete overhaul of the branch currently used:
- Part 1: block rendering reimplementation:
    - add an new attribute / class for storing face info of block
    - implement system to rotate vertices & face names
    - implement system to show/hide separated faces
    - rework TextureAtlas system to NOT add rotated variants, rather rotate with above system
    - redo custom block rendering, maybe add some form of registry for it
    - redo alpha drawing

    - implement system to colorize blocks based on an attribute to the rendering system
        [maybe an custom block renderer?]
    - implement this to grass block


- Part 2:
