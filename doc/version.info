Roadmap (for internal_changes; X means "must be done before release", more X's mean higher priority):
    - revisit build system, maybe add obfuscated build with obfuscation mappings for MDK [WIP]
X   - rewrite how assets are stored  [WIP]
    - do not hardcode constants, move them to an public space / config files / resource data
    - clean up changelog.txt, issues.txt and fixed_issues.txt
X   - fix respawning in blocks
X   - fix having two separated item atlas storages? -> one NEVER used? -> old may have been used at the slot bug?
X   - fix being able to break blocks in gamemode 0 which you should not be able to (e.g. bedrock)
    - make world generator mode system class or object based
    - fix furnace gui texture
    - fix grass texture by introducing an coloring layer or temporary another texture
    - fix shulker boxes (and similar blocks?) not storing their inventory correctly
XX  - fix post-generation code not generating correctly

    - refactor event names
    - do not read inventory config for each inventory, load it ones & share
