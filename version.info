issues to implement / fix
todo: fix bug: player dies in debug world when on normal blocks -> error in check function y < -10 somehow
todo: fix bug: stone blocks are shown during generation so they appear at not-wanted positions
todo: fix bug: somehow, block (?) items get alpha-data in hotbar sometimes & number of items is not drawn,
        maybe due to an clear & draw error?
todo: fix bug: in some rare cases, mouse up is not handled an will cause blocks to be added until game close
todo: fix bug: when resizing block item generation, items are not correctly generated
todo: fix bug: moving slot is on first load somtimes not at mouse
todo: fix bug: registries are not locked on startup
todo: fix bug: when NOT rebuilding and entering the world, in first esc-state, bgcolor will be white

other tasks that should be done in near future
todo: add function to tools
todo: add item image atlases (see https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/programming_guide/image.html)
todo: add armor pieces, make armor slots only accept armor
todo: add brake animation on block (draw with alpha over the block?)
todo: store breaketime somewhere so the function is not callen every tick
todo: add bars for harts, hunger, xp, armor level

an update to the system of states
todo: add an option to toggle world generation size
todo: add an back-button to world gen config
todo: add some kind of info to screen for generation
todo: add an quite game button to start screen
todo: add an button "go to github project" which opens the internet browser with an link to github
todo: make the info label hide-able by key combo (maybe an StatePart which is activated & deactivated?)
todo: game info label is not good formatted (spacing)
todo: set the caption to something like "mcpython" and make every other caption base on it (may be an new set_caption-method?)
todo: make StateParts don't need implement their own hide / shown event bind functions
todo: add an real start menu background & option background
todo: add option to add own parts to state / make an IStateExtension-baseclass which can be assigned with any other
    state and will help adding own element into it
