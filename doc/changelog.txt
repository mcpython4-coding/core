    - entity AI system
    - make loot table system only load needed loot tables, etc.
    - BlockItemGenerator should be replaced by an in-game block renderer

information on development:
    - the development is split up into 2 phases: the dev-branch with changes to the code and the final releases pushed
        to release-branch and published as a release on github
    - developing happens also on feature branches were bigger features can be tested. It is not guaranteed that any
        if this features will make its way into the final release.
    - PR's should target dev or in some cases the feature branches, only for critical bug fixes the release-branch
    - this file will keep track on every development leading into an snapshot or release. The dev-branch will be used
        for creating the entries. Every new snapshot changelog starts with "changelog of <type> <name>" with optional
        following the theme of the snapshot, the release date and additional information. The changelog should be
        an grouped list of changes after topic in an logical order with all not noticeable changes removed
        followed optional by an table of issues starting with "Fixed issues:" followed by an list of grouped after
        first occurrence of the bug the list of issues with an short description and when based on an github bug report
        its github id.
    - developers may want to create test builds for themselves. run dev/generate_test_build.py for it.
        When doing so, DO NOT INCLUDE version.json from root, as it will update the build ID of it
    - develop a PyCharm plugin for FactoryBuilder type hints, and mod dev stuff

        - allowing now python 3.10, as all our dependencies have upgraded their support

    Registries:
        - some work on deferred registries, and the other registry parts

    Rendering:
        - window caption contains now in dev version branch name + last commit hash

    Bug Fixes:
        - BlockItemGenerator was doing not what it was supposed to do

    Gameplay:
        - creative item search tab is now filled with items

    Capabilities:
        - implemented capability API
        - currently supports items [AbstractItem instance, not ItemStack], blocks and entities
        - can be disabled for entries in the system
        - WARNING: block & item implementation is linked to some public-facing serialization code, meaning
            mods which are not careful enough may override the needed bindings

    Blocks:
        - block serialization code (the public facing dump_data() and inject()) were rewritten, mods
            overriding these will encounter issues!

    Networking & dedicated server:
        - added more networking code, including first real packages, including:
            - handshake (both directions)
            - sync packages (package ID's, registry content, mod list)
            - disconnection packages (init & response)
        - fixed some bugs existing in the networking API

        - fixed dedicated servers doing no mod loading, no world generation, and in general acting not like
            a game instance

        - mod loading order is no longer stable (inside the dependencies)

    Internals:
        - a big chunk of refactoring, most mods will NOT work

    Block Item Generator:
        - some internal changes, more fail-save, will not generate as much noise when something fails, will skip
            blocks with no-rendering, but will be mostly faster

    Rendering:
        - internal optimisations for the rendering system, refactored some bits, removed unneeded stuff


changelog of snapshot 21w23a released on 9.6.2021 targeting 1.17

            - storage drawers, tested with 1.16.3-8.2.2

        Any other mod may or may not load; Implementation wrappers for parts are welcome to be PR'ed
        We cannot guarantee any mod to load as out system changes rapidly

        - ItemFactory is now also created by FactoryBuilder
        - this is breaking existing code, again...
        - added a new combined factory system using in-memory calculations

    Build System:
        - improved undocumented build
        - started writing a binary building API based on https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka

changelog of snapshot 21w01a, released on 06.01.2021, targeting 20w51a
    Happy new year, 2021!
    This time, breaks again some big parts
    Affected are world generation and mod loading stage modifications, and loading-order-dependent stuff, beside
        following some general structure [block models after blocks, etc.]

    WARNING: this version has a major visual glitch which could not be fixed until today

    API:
        If you see this, you know that something broke again...
        - Broke BlockFactory system. Nothing will work!
        - Planning on breaking ItemFactory also...
        - ... and CombinedFactories will also be rewritten in the near future
        - even data-driven block and items may get a thing :-/
        - the new factory system is highly extendable, but may consume some more memory on the fly :-(
        - I tried to make it as fast as before, but I cannot guarantee anything at this point
        - the API is "similar" to the old, with refactors and no direct-attribute accesses anymore :-/

    World Generation:
        - noises are now better selected per world-seed, making them more compatible for mods
        - general faster [see rendering stuff below]
        - modes and biomes can now be serialized to files
        - modes can now simply be modified via files
        - features are now part of the registry system [previously, they weren't]

    Rendering:
        - improved general API
        - refactored some stuff
        - improved client/server separation
        - improved some rendering parts

    Resources:
        - implemented helper code for resource groups
        - fixed some errors around loading mod resources

    Loading:
        - rewritten how loading stages are selected
        - order may change now where no dependency is
        - you can add dependencies if needed special order
        - custom loading stages are currently hard to create [internal cache must be re-calculated],
            events for existing stages are simpler
        - there might be various errors around this, it is highly experimental

    Gameplay:
        - items can now set which blocks they can break in gamemode 2

    Behind-the-scenes:
        - improved memory usage for loading event annotations
        - improved memory usage in BlockFaceState for hidden blocks

    Server:
        - added foundation for a server launcher

changelog of snapshot 20w24a released on 10.06.2020 (theme: refactoring & data generators)
    WARNING: this snapshot WILL break some backward-compatibility as it moved a lot of stuff around. Use the constants
        in globals.py for allocation.
    WARNING: this snapshot adds data generators. They are useful, but currently complicated to set up. We will add
        in the future an mdk generator script for setting up an mdk package with all run-configurations,
        launcher bindings and useful helper scripts like building it into an final zip file
    WARNING: this snapshot changed the way how the dev-environment is packaged. This may lead into problems
    WARNING: this snapshot changed the way how final end-user directories look like and what can be modified,
        See globals.py for the locations, do NOT use G.local+"/build/[...]", use G.build+"/[...]"!!!!
    WARNING: as data generators are now an thing, you can NOT rely on that your game will load up completely as an mod.
        There is the extreme "--data-gen --exit-after-data-gen --no-window" mode in which no window will open
        (and as so now draw-events or user interactions are called, only ticks) and the game will exit after the
        data gen is finished (via an extra loading stage)

    - added system to build the project into one stand-alone zip-archive

    Modding:
        - changed version tuple builder for mcpython
        - added data generator system, moved a lot of internal stuff to there, mods are free to use it
        - data generators are arrival for BlockModel's, BlockState's, EntityModel's, Recipes and Tags
        - as the data gen system exists, the old factories for data-gen-converted stuff are now deprecated and will be
            removed until a1.5.0

    Debugging:
        - added profiler system with config options
        - made inventory interaction subscriptions more fail-self

    Project Structure:
        - refactored most of the stuff into the mcypthon-folder, but the folder itself is added to sys.path for backward
            compatibility [WARNING: this is an breaking change!!!!!!!!]
        - refactored much not-code related files into the home-folder
        - refactored & unpacked assets into the resources-folder
        - moved crafting-folder to gui/crafting, old interfaces still exists, but are deprecated

    Execution:
        - added the following command line arguments: --data-gen. --exit-after-data-gen and --no-window.
            First will generate the data (the data gen for the core will only work in dev-environment), second will
            auto-exit the game when data-gen is finished (needs --data-gen also) and last will not open an window.

    fixed issues:
        long-term issues:
