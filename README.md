# mcpython-4
these is the fourth version of an minecraft-like, python-written game based on forgleman's code

How to setup?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-download python 3.7 (or any other 3.n version, but I have tested only 3.7)

-download these project, extract it and open the console in this directory

run in console: pip install -r requirements.txt




How to run?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type in console in the extracted project "python \_\_main\_\_.py".



What if I have worked on textures or added/removed an texture pack or added/removed blocks?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please run the project with "python \_\_main\_\_.py --rebuild". It will take longer than normal but will invaildate the cache and rebuild it.
