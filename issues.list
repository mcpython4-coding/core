[issue 1-8 are part of github-only and are mostly fixed at the moment]

issue 22:
    bug: on an tower of sand blocks if the under block is removed, it updates not the other blocks. If the block above
         is removed, it all updates following bug 23
    strategy: debug where block updates are called & why the block is not updated correct

issue 23:
    bug: when sand is falling, it can fall more than 1 block at a time, see issue 22 for reproducing
    possible reason: fall is active two times in TickHandler

issue 28:
    bug: F3+A - hot-key does not reload the world correctly
    since: unknown, found after fixing issue 19 & implementing hot-keys
    possible fix: rewrite this part of Chunk's method's

issue 34:
    bug: jumping from downwards into an block, you get damage
    since: block damage was introduced
    fix: rewrite collision system

issue 35:
    bug: going inside an non-full block will give you damage instead of bouncing of the block
    since: block damage was introduced
    fix: check for solid block
    better fix: use rewritten collision system based on AABB's to determine if you are in an block

issue 55:
    bug: alpha textures are rendered not behind alpha-textures
    since: alpha rendering was implemented
    fix: order alpha face rendering! (maybe implement an AlphaRenderingRenderer extends ICustomDrawRenderer)

issue 80: [unable to reproduce, check and mark as resolved when not occur anymore]
    bug: in some cases, mouse button up is still not handled

issue 100:
    bug: fps counter is constantly changing making it hard to read from
    possible fix: implement some average fps system

issue 113:
    bug: "uv-lock"-parameter is ignored in block-states
    fix: implement [see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Model]

issue 118:
    bug: block models ignore rescale parameter in elements
    fix: implement [see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Model]

issue 122:
    bug: z-fighting at border between two fences
    possible fix: decrease box size of fences by hand

issue 129:
    bug: some fence faces are not rendered [invalid texture rotation?]

issue 137:
    bug: coal block has no fuel level [maybe general problem?]

issue 139:
    bug: during in-game generation, block faces of neighbor chunks are not updated
    possible fix: update all blocks next to the new chunk

issue 140:
    bug: sometimes, you fall through one or more block (in gamemode 0)
        reproduce:
            use diamond pickaxe and break stone blocks until bottom of world in gamemode 0

issue 148:
    bug: block info display screen does NOT display position. Instead, (?, ?, ?) is shown
    possible reason: wrong game-rule parsing

issue 150:
    bug: blocks are not shown at e.g. (1e+18, 100, 0)
    fix A: write something like an draw-area which will move the chunk relative position & camera position when you
        are far enough out
    fix B: add world barrier at high x/z coordinates and do not let player walk away

issue 151:
    bug: block coordinates are not relative in saves to chunk position making save take longer for outer chunks than for
        inner (see 150 for reproducing)
    fix: make chunk coordinates relative

issue 154:
    bug: debug world blocks do NOT use block-state
