These is an tasklist covering all diffrent tasks these project has.

cleanup tasks (should be done regulary):
    document every change
    go to EVERY PYTHON FILE and do:
        have we unused imports? -> delete
        look at EVERY name and check if it is good
        has every file, class & function an docstring?
        is the code with enough comments?
        is every code reachable?
        have we outdated code which should be updated?
        is there an way for every interested function / field to overwrite
        could this file splitted into diffrent?
        could this class be splitted into seperated / super - child classes?
        could this function be splitted into diffrent for better handling?
        should be this function be part of the util-code?
        is there any library or any code around web that does this better / can replace this?
        should be some of these code be part of an load-event?
        should be any of this classes/objects/functions be part of an registry?
        are here any texture-generating codes which can be represented by texture generator code?
        could be parts of these generated on setup?
        is there code which should be as config / world config / world storage data stored?

add logs & log base class
add trees to world gen
add save / load of world
add option for inventories to be visable when another is also visable
add loot tables for block drops


todo: fix crafting shift click
todo: fix bug: can't combine two itemstacks in inventory
todo: fix bug: in some rare cases, you can walk through the corner into the block
todo: fix bug: in chat, " " and SHIFT are used for higher / lower position in gamemode 1
todo: implement base_image to slot for base item & bind to armor & offhand slots

make an load.py file with most of the content of the __main__ file and the __main__-file should only launch it
add an setup.py-file for setting up all code fragments, make an event for it, use load.py to get data and then launch
    event
split everything into seperated load events which are called ones per ones
make an registry base class, an registry handler and registry locks
add PlayerCreativeInventory, PlayerCreativeTab
add BlockInventory-attribute to Block for auto-opening an inventory
add /loot-command
add can_brake-attribute to item to definite items that can brake blocks in gamemode 2
add the following block inventorys: crafting table, furnes and furnes-like inventorys, brewing stand, anvil, enchantment table
add Enchantment-baseclass with attribute is_combineable_with(...) -> bool & all enchanments
add Tool-baseclass and Tool-durability
optimize BlockItemGenerator to have shorter times
add commands: /me, /say, /msg, /tellraw, /title, /replaceitem, /debug, /reload, /clone, /?
add braketime-attribute to Block, use it in window brake system (also in StatePartGame)
add datapacks with .mcfunction-files, add resourcelocator binding for recipes, add /function & /shedule -command
fix missing resize of image-parts when using only a part of it
make the following attributes as json-saved files: Block.is_brake_able, Block.brake_time, Item.tool_types, Item.max_durability, Item.braketime_of
add update.py for downloading latest build of mcpython and unpacking it
add ItemModelLoader
add datapack, resourcepack (binding to resourcelocator)
add ModInterface
add time-system and /time-command
add scoreboards
add entitys with handler, add an batch to system for rendering them OR use seperated classes

implement client/server by making an @client and @server notation system which will decide returning an callable object
    representing an network or direct access to the function (so afterwards changeable by joining server)
