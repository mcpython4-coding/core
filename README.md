# mcpython-4
these is the fours version of an minecraft-like, python-written game based on forgleman's code

How to setup?

-download python 3.7 (or any other 3.n version, but I have tested only 3.7)

-download these project, extract it and opem the console in these directory
run in console: pip install -r requirements.txt

How to run?

type in console in the extracted project "py \_\_main\_\_.py"


What if I have worked on textures / added/removed an texture pack / added/removed blocks?

please run the project ones with "py \_\_main\_\_.py --rebuild". It will take longer than normal but will re-do some texture related stuff
