When pyglet 2 comes out, it will focus on OpenGL >= 3.0 leading into an overhaul of the intern direct-OpenGL calls.

Every feature by pyglet should be automatically ported, but the following things are direct-OpenGL calling in this
project:
- setup 2d/3d/alpha on/off
- util/opengl.py stuff
- BoxModel rendering, EntityRenderer
- use pyglet.matrix where rendering/MatrixStack is used
