This is an complete overhaul of the branch currently used:

Part 2:
    - implement system to colorize blocks based on an attribute to the rendering system
        [maybe an custom block renderer?]
    - implement this to grass block

beside this:
    - make text in chat selectable, implement STRG+X
    - add mc icon
    - add F3-screen with extra info if the chunk is fully generated or not
    - redo alpha drawing
    - make loading events split up for the different mods & models [e.g. model filtering]
