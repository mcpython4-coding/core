add shift-click & drag-click to inventories
add middle-click to slots
rewrite Slot - SlotCopy connection
add special slots: infinite, custom stack size, cleanup, copy [store an copy of the item, do not consume it]
add an option to let items stay in crafting table when closing [global inventory vs. per-block inventory]
add an system for handling shift-clicking correctly
    [maybe add an ShiftHandler with two sets which can shift between each other or implement an ShiftClickProvider with
     an field linking to another ShiftClickingProvider storing the movement]
