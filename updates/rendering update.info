This is an complete overhaul of the branch currently used:

Part 2:
    - add way for blocks to add their own group for rendering with batches
    - implement system to colorize blocks based on an attribute to the rendering system
        [maybe an custom block renderer?] -> use custom group for batching
    -> implement this to grass block

beside this:
    - make text in chat selectable, implement STRG+X, fix cursor movement, add mouse button selection
    - add F3-screen with extra info if the chunk is fully generated or not
    - redo alpha drawing with maybe separated group?
    - make loading events split up for the different mods & models [e.g. model filtering]
