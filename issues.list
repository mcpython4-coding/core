[issue 1-8 are part of github-only and are mostly fixed at the moment]

issue 9:
    when you add new blocks without rebuilding, BlockItemGenerator creates the item images, but fails to create
        Item-instances
    this issue occurs only in the first run with the new block
    possible fix: create item tables only when BlockItemFactory has finished
    better fix: remove BlockItemGenerator & replace by drawing of the corresponding block in the slot in 3d

issue 22:
    bug: on an tower of sand blocks if the under block is removed, it updates not the other blocks. If the block above
         is removed, it all updates following bug 23
    strategy: debug where block updates are called & why the block is not updated correct

issue 23:
    bug: when sand is falling, it can fall more than 1 block at a time, see issue 22 for reproducing
    possible reason: fall is active two times in TickHandler

issue 28:
    bug: F3+A - hot-key does not reload the world correctly
    since: unknown, found after fixing issue 19 & implementing hot-keys
    possible fix: rewrite this part of Chunk's method's

issue 34:
    bug: jumping from downwards into an block, you get damage
    since: block damage was introduced
    fix: rewrite collision system

issue 35:
    bug: going inside an non-full block will give you damage
    since: block damage was introduced
    fix: check for solid block
    better fix: use rewritten collision system based on AABB's to determine if you are in an block

issue 55:
    bug: alpha textures are rendered not behind alpha-textures
    since: alpha rendering was implemented
    possible fix: disable depth test & order faces by ourselves OR change rendering mode

issue 80:
    bug: in some cases, mouse button up is still not handled

issue 96:
    bug: SlotCopy does not always work correctly
    possible fix: rewrite SlotCopy
