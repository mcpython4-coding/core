information on development:
    - the development is split up into 3 phases: the dev-branch with changes to the code, snapshots pushed to release,
        but not published as releases on github, and the final releases pushed to release-branch and published as#
        an release
    - developing happens also on feature branches were bigger features can be tested. It is not guaranteed that any
        if this features will make its way into the final release.
    - PR's should target master or in some cases the feature branches, only for critical bug fixes the release-branch
    - this file will keep track on every development leading into an snapshot or release. The dev-branch will be used
        for creating the entries. Every new snapshot changelog starts with "changelog of <type> <name>" with optional
        following the theme of the snapshot, the release date and additional information. The changelog than can
        be in two formats:
        a) when not released yet:
            - an list of changes in the order of introduction
        b) in the final release:
            - an grouped list of changes after topic in an logical order with all not noticeable changes removed
        both can be followed by an table of issues starting with "fixed issues:" followed by an list of grouped after
        first obscures of the bug the list of issues with an short description and when based on an github bug report
        its id.
