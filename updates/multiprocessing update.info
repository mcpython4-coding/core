goal: make the code multiprocessing based


possible processes:
    - ProcessCom-class for providing an data pipeline between processes with various modes [e.g. python >= 3.8 ->
            SharedMemory]
    - system to share the world across the processes using shared memory or something like this

    - main thread (in which pyglet runs)
    - world thread (in which the whole world lives)
    - generation thread(s): for generation code, maybe split up per-layer
    - command execution: execute commands in separated
