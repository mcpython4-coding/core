[issue 1-8 are part of github-only and are mostly fixed at the moment]


issue 28: [caused by issue 185]
    bug: F3+A - hot-key does not reload the world correctly
    since: unknown, found after fixing issue 19 & implementing hot-keys
    possible fix: rewrite this part of the method of the Chunk-class

issue 34:
    bug: jumping from downwards into an block, you get damage
    since: block damage was introduced
    fix: rewrite collision system & check for overlap value

issue 35:
    bug: going inside an non-full block will give you damage instead of bouncing of the block (e.g. glass)
    since: block damage was introduced
    fix: check for solid block
    better fix: use rewritten collision system based on AABB's to determine if you are in an block or not

issue 55:
    bug: alpha textures are not rendered behind alpha-textures
    since: alpha rendering was implemented
    fix: order alpha face rendering! (maybe implement an AlphaRenderingRenderer extends ICustomDrawRenderer)

issue 80:
    bug: in some cases, mouse button up is still not handled
    fix: call mouse button up event before changing the active state only on the event bus for it

issue 113:
    bug: "uv-lock"-parameter is ignored in block-states
    fix: implement [see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Model]

issue 118:
    bug: block models ignore rescale parameter in elements
    fix: implement [see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Model]

issue 122:
    bug: z-fighting at border between two fences
    possible fix: decrease box size of fences "by hand" (manipulate model data)

issue 139:
    bug: during in-game generation, block faces of neighbor chunks are not updated
    possible fix: update all blocks next to the new chunk OR remove the hide-faces in not generated chunks

issue 140:
    bug: (sometimes, )you fall through one or more block (in gamemode 0)
        reproduce:
            use e.g. diamond pickaxe and break stone blocks until bottom of world in gamemode 0

issue 157:
    bug: loading hangs before showing the chunk loading screen due to deserialization times
    fix: add color indicating that the deserialization is in progress

issue 159:
    bug: various maps are stored not chunk-relative making file size big at outer positions
    fix: implement relative-storage

issue 161:
    bug: when saving, moving slot is not saved
    fix: like in kill-method, force-close all inventories on save
    other fix: save moving slot also & load it [warning: also save what inventories are open]

issue 164:
    bug: saving/loading big worlds take long time
    fix: do NOT load every time the whole .region file, store it in RAM [we have enough of it]
    additional fix: load them part by part
    3rd fix: move to other process

issue 165:
    bug: changing chunks in an big world takes a long time due to internal re-calculations
    fix: see issue 164

issue 168:
    bug: when starting in-game generation, game hangs for an moment
    fix: make generation off-thread

issue 175:
    bug: structures overlapping into not-generated chunks are not shown when the chunks respecify are generated
    fix: add an special list of pre-generated blocks which is injected into actual generation task array when the chunk
        generation is requested

issue 176:
    bug: structures overlapping into not-generated chunks are not saved (?)
    fix: see issue 175

issue 177:
    bug: grass block faces generated next to leaves are not visible
    possible cause: wrong is_solid calculation?

issue 178:
    bug: hotbar is not transparent(rendered)
    fix: enable alpha blending in this phase [somehow not correctly working!]

issue 185:
    bug: in big worlds, chunks can get randomly hidden (or unloaded?) [e.g. debug world]
    fix: implement chunk load ticket system [WIP]
    root cause search: implement logger for unloading & hiding chunks
    temporary fix: prevent from unloading [for some short moment, they get unloaded]

issue 196:
    bug: when in gui and picking up an itemstack during holding one, it gets reset
    reproduce: craft one thing with an item in mouse and the item is not picked up

issue 199:  [removed with save rework]
    bug: dynamic generated dimension ids are not saved in saves leading into miss-matches when changing dimension
         list
    fix: add them to the storage system and re-assign on load

issue 217:  [removed with save rework]
    bug: certain save data, including chest content, can get lost when loading a world [see warnings in log]

issue 235:
    bug: tools are CONSUMED when using them
