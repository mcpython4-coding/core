issue 9:
    when you add new blocks without rebuilding, BlockItemGenerator creates the item images, but fails to create
        Item-instances
    this issue occurs only in the first run with the new block

issue 10:
    occurs since: upgrade to python 3.8, release date of it

    in python 3.8.1, a lot of exceptions of the following style are printed out when closing the window:
        Exception ignored in: <function WeakMethod.__new__.<locals>._cb at 0x0F426D18>
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "%python%\lib\weakref.py", line 58, in _cb
          File "%python%\lib\site-packages\pyglet\event.py", line 364, in _remove_handler
          File "%python%\lib\weakref.py", line 74, in __eq__
        TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a type or tuple of types

    possible fix: implement overwriting file for pyglet/event.py to fix this issue from pyglet side

issue 16:
    bug: random ticks are never called
    since: random ticks were disabled
    possible fix: implement an call_in_active_tick-method to TickHandler & use it for random ticks

    possible fix strategy: use debug mode of running to reproduce
