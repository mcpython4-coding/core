[issue 1-8 are part of github-only and are mostly fixed at the moment]

issue 9: [seems fixed, please check]
    when you add new blocks without rebuilding, BlockItemGenerator creates the item images, but fails to create
        Item-instances in the same run
    this issue occurs only in the first run with the new block
    possible fix: create item tables only when BlockItemFactory has finished
    better fix: remove BlockItemGenerator & replace by drawing of the corresponding block in the slot in 3d

issue 22:
    bug: on an tower of sand blocks if the under block is removed, it updates not the other blocks. If the block above
         is removed, it all updates following bug 23
    strategy: debug where block updates are called & why the block is not updated correct

issue 23:
    bug: when sand is falling, it can fall more than 1 block at a time, see issue 22 for reproducing
    possible reason: fall is active two times in TickHandler

issue 28:
    bug: F3+A - hot-key does not reload the world correctly
    since: unknown, found after fixing issue 19 & implementing hot-keys
    possible fix: rewrite this part of Chunk's method's

issue 34:
    bug: jumping from downwards into an block, you get damage
    since: block damage was introduced
    fix: rewrite collision system

issue 35:
    bug: going inside an non-full block will give you damage instead of bouncing of the block
    since: block damage was introduced
    fix: check for solid block
    better fix: use rewritten collision system based on AABB's to determine if you are in an block

issue 55:
    bug: alpha textures are rendered not behind alpha-textures
    since: alpha rendering was implemented
    fix: order alpha face rendering! (maybe implement an AlphaRenderingRenderer extends ICustomDrawRenderer)

issue 80:
    bug: in some cases, mouse button up is still not handled

issue 100:
    bug: fps counter is constantly changing making it hard to read from
    possible fix: implement some average fps system
    solution: maybe WAI

issue 113:
    bug: "uv-lock"-parameter is ignored in block-states
    fix: implement [see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Model]

issue 118:
    bug: block models ignore rescale parameter in elements
    fix: implement [see https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Model]

issue 122:
    bug: z-fighting at border between two fences
    possible fix: decrease box size of fences "by hand" (manipulate model data)

issue 129:
    bug: some fence faces are not rendered [invalid texture rotation, internal miss-match in order of texture-coord?]

issue 139:
    bug: during in-game generation, block faces of neighbor chunks are not updated
    possible fix: update all blocks next to the new chunk OR remove the hide-faces in not generated chunks

issue 140:
    bug: (sometimes, )you fall through one or more block (in gamemode 0)
        reproduce:
            use diamond pickaxe and break stone blocks until bottom of world in gamemode 0

issue 150:
    bug: float point precision loos at high coordinates e.g. [only occur on block rendering]:
     - at z=1000000: world is "wobbing" around -> movements are not shown correctly
     - at z=1010000: hit-boxes begin loosing their shape
     - at z=1100000: movement gets "jumpy"
     - at z=2000000: cube faces start to get un-flatened, hitbox is not rendered anymore
     - at z=3000000: entire blocks start to get invisible, all cube faces are not flat anymore
     - at z=4000000: textures are now partwise stretched, all previous effects are getting worse
     - at z=5000000: world is partwise invisible completely, cull-face rendering issues
     - at z=6000000: cube faces are broken into several peaces in some cases, strip-wise rendering, face doubling
        [I was still able to render from time to time parts of an hitbox, but not at where they are supposed to]
     - at z=7000000: OpenGL fails in parts to order the colors after depth [depth buffer fails?]
     - at z=8000000: world is more than half not visible, textures are more scattered
     - at z=9000000: FOV seems broken
     - at z=10000000: world is in an state where rendering nearly is completely broken
     ... [somewhere, rendering stops completely due to above rendering problems]

     fix A: add some form of world barrier
     fix B: move integers to move rendering of world first, than apply an relative player coordinate, store every coord
        as an tuple of (sector x, sector z, dx, y, dz) where x=10**(4*"sector x")+dx and z respectively
        (-> maybe add an FloatPosition-class handling all this stuff)
     fix C: use the decimal module for handling the floats [warning: OpenGL may cause problems when using the module]

issue 157:
    bug: loading hangs before showing the chunk loading screen due to deserialization times
    fix: add color indicating that the deserialization is in progress

issue 159:
    bug: various maps are stored not chunk-relative making file size big at outer positions
    fix: implement relative-storage with data-fixer

issue 161:
    bug: when saving, moving slot is not saved
    fix: like in kill-method, force-close all inventories on save
    other fix: save moving slot also & load it [warning: also save what inventories are open]

issue 164:
    bug: saving/loading big worlds take ages
    fix: do NOT load every time the whole .region file, store it in RAM [we have enough of it]

issue 165:
    bug: changing chunks in an big world takes ages
    fix: see issue 164

issue 166:
    bug: world generation is slow

issue 168:
    bug: when starting in-game generation, game hangs for an short moment

issue 174:
    bug: loading bars of mod-loading are not in the middle

issue 175:
    bug: structures overlapping into not-generated chunks are not shown when the chunks respecify are generated
    fix: add an special list of pre-generated blocks which is injected into actual generation task array when the chunk
        generation is requested

issue 176:
    bug: structures overlapping into not-generated chunks are not saved
    fix: see issue 175

issue 177:
    bug: grass block faces generated next to leaves are not visible

issue 178:
    bug: hotbar is not transparent(rendered)

issue 181:
    bug: when disabling work-around fix in player, another player is rendered

issue 185:
    bug: in big worlds, chunks can get randomly hidden
