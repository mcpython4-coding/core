[issue 1-8 are part of github-only and are mostly fixed at the moment]

issue 9:
    when you add new blocks without rebuilding, BlockItemGenerator creates the item images, but fails to create
        Item-instances
    this issue occurs only in the first run with the new block
    possible fix: create item tables only when BlockItemFactory has finished
    better fix: remove BlockItemGenerator & replace by drawing of the corresponding block in the slot in 3d

issue 22:
    bug: on an tower of sand blocks if the under block is removed, it updates not the other blocks. If the block above
         is removed, it all updates following bug 23
    strategy: debug where block updates are called & why the block is not updated correct

issue 23:
    bug: when sand is falling, it falls more than 1 block at a time, see issue 22 for reproducing
    possible reason: fall is active two times in TickHandler

issue 24:
    bug: hit-box of blocks are at the corners not working [see fogleman #104]
    possible fix: rework whole hit-box system (of blocks) [AABBs?]

issue 28:
    bug: F3+A does not reload the world correctly
    since: unknown, found after fixing issue 19 & implementing hot-keys
    possible fix: rewrite this part of Chunk's method's

issue 34:
    bug: jumping from downwards into an block, you get damage
    since: block damage was introduced
    fix: rewrite collision system

issue 35:
    bug: going inside an non-full block will give you damage
    since: block damage was introduced
    fix: check for solid block
    better fix: use rewritten collision system based on AABB's to determine if you are in an block

issue 55:
    bug: alpha textures are rendered not behind alpha-textures
    since: alpha rendering was implemented
    possible fix: disable depth test & order faces by ourselves OR change rendering mode

issue 75:
    bug: ender chest & christmas chest texture is wrong on top
    since: texture update to 1.15.2
    possible fix: update texture coord system
    better fix: update models to use correct UV's
    even better fix: implement CustomBlockRenderer for rendering it

issue 80:
    bug: in some cases, mouse button up is still not handled

issue 95:
    bug: in some cases, blocks are added double in debug world
    found: during testing mod block system loading, maybe when new during not pre-build phase
    possible fix: make sure that every block is added ones into debug world list
    better fix: find reason for duplication
    even better fix: add an IRegisterAble-object base class containing an NAME attribute and an TYPE attribute,
       change event.Registry to register this types, add an option to override existing objects, otherwise add error msg
       and crash. Make sure that it is past-compatible

issue 96:
    bug: SlotCopy does not always work correctly
    possible fix: rewrite SlotCopy

issue 97:
    bug: slots in hotbar can be highlighted
    possible fix: add new attribute to Slot which disables the hovering rendering

issue 98:
    bug: when moving & reinserting an item in hotbar from player inventory main the item in the hotbar is not rendered
    possible fix: see issue 96

issue 100:
    bug: fps counter is constantly changing making it hard to read from
    possible fix: implement some average fps system
